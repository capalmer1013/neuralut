- kivy sucks for everything. back to tkinter, looks 90s AF but we good
- new command is `pyinstaller -F -w tkintertest.py --icon neuralut.ico -n neuralut.exe`

- there might be a problem with openlut, look into alternatives
- build command `pyinstaller -F -w kivytest.py --icon neuralut.ico -n neuralut.exe`
- trying to get command `pyinstaller kivytest.spec` to create an exe that actually shows the ui... turns out it worked. I was just doing it wrong it's far too late to be working on this
